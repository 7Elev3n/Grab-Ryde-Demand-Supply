# To-Do

Model Plan:

1. Agents: Riders, Customers. 
2. Define global parameters:
	- Relative populations of agents 
	- Utility function (Cobb-Douglas?)
	- Company parameters:
		- Commission per delivery
		- Incentives after x number of deliveries
		- Financial Reserves (from company share of delivery fee) + Fee margin
3. Model "Willingness to Pay" (WTP) of each agent
4. Riders:
	- Distance to deliver?
	- Time of day?
	- $/minute earned?
	- How close to incentive is the rider?
5. Customers:
	- Fixed demand?
	- Time of day?
